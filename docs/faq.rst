How can I ask questions or report bugs?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can send emails to  Slim_TPCA@googlegroups.com . Another option is the discussion page on github: https://github.com/wangjun258/Slim_TPCA/discussions . Before doing so, please read the documents and first try to find out if things are already there.

For reporting bugs, you can also open a issue on https://github.com/wangjun258/Slim_TPCA/issues .

If you meet with a bug, please first try to upgrade to the latest version to see if it is still there. And when reporting a bug, please post the inputs, the Slim_TPCA command, and the version of Slim_TPCA being used if possible. Should these files be kept secret, try to reproduce the bug in a simple system.
