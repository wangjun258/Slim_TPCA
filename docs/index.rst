Welcome to TB2J's documentation!
================================

 TB2J is an open source Python package for the automatic computation of magnetic interactions (including exchange and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya) between atoms of magnetic crystals from density functional Hamiltonians based on Wannierfunctions or linear combination of atomic orbitals.  The program is based on the Greenâ€™s function method with the local rigid spin rotation treated as a perturbation.  As input, the package uses the output of either Wannier90, whichis interfaced with many density functional theory packages, or of codes based on localized orbitals.  A minimal userinput is needed, which allows for easy integration into high-throughput workflows.
 The source code can be found at `https://github.com/mailhexu/TB2J <https://github.com/mailhexu/TB2J>`_.
 For questions please use the online forum at `<https://groups.google.com/g/tb2j>`_, or send email to `<tb2j@googlegroup.com>`_.
