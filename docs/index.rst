Welcome to Slim_TPCA's documentation!
================================

 Slim_TPCA is an open source Python package for the automatic computation of magnetic interactions (including exchange and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya) between atoms of magnetic crystals from density functional Hamiltonians based on Wannierfunctions or linear combination of atomic orbitals.  The program is based on the Greenâ€™s function method with the local rigid spin rotation treated as a perturbation.  As input, the package uses the output of either Wannier90, whichis interfaced with many density functional theory packages, or of codes based on localized orbitals.  A minimal userinput is needed, which allows for easy integration into high-throughput workflows.
